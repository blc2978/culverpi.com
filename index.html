<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As I said above, this is my experience with web design, but I'm finding it to be very interesting. I'm using a book, <i>HTML and CSS</i> by Jon Duckett, as a reference to help me along the way while I'm getting my feet under me. I'm uncertain as to what I'd like to do for a career, so maybe a front-end developer could someday be a possibility!</span></p>

<h3> Summer 2017 Road Trip </h3>
<p> This summer, myself and three close friends went on a cross country road trip in a 12 passenger van. We took 21 days and saw four different national parks; Yellowstone, Zion, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon. I have a passion for photography, and have listed a few of my favorite photos taken along the way. </p>
