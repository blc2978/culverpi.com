	<h2>Why This Website?</h2>
	<p>The reason for making this site was to help me explore programming and web design. The site is hosted on my home raspberry pi that is running Apache Webserver. I'm using a book, <i>HTML and CSS</i> by Jon Duckett, as a reference to help me along the way while I'm getting my feet under me. In addition to helping me learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site will serve as a networking resource with my contact information, as well as a creative outlet for my photography. </p>

	<h3>Summer 2017 Road Trip</h3>
	<p>This summer, myself and three close friends went on a cross-country raod trip in a 12 passenger van. We took 21 days and visited multiple national parks including Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. Listed are a few of my favorite photos taken along the way.</p>
