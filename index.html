	<h1>Bailey Culver's Pi Web Server</h1>
	<p>My name is <b>Bailey Culver</b> and I'm a first semester student at Virginia Tech. I'm from Warrenton, Virginia and recently transferred to Tech from Northern Virginia Community College. I am currently undecided on a major, but am considering <b>Economics, Business Information Technology,</b>and <b>Food Science and Technology</b> as potential fields of study.</p>

	<h2>This is My First Website</h2>
	<p>As I said above, this is my first experience with web design, but I'm finding it to be very interesting. I'm using a book, <i>HTML and CSS</i> by Jon Duckett, as a reference to help me along the way while I'm getting my feet under me.</p>

	<h3>Summer 2017 Road Trip</h3>
	<p>This summer, myself and three close friends went on a cross-country raod trip in a 12 passenger van. We took 21 days and visited multiple national parks including Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. I have a passion for photography, and have listed a few of my favorite photos taken along the way.</p>
